    Got a new laptop, tested there. The wxPython that came with Enthought Python was too old for push,
    the latest version worked, but required minor change to phoneshell.py to work.

Nov 5, 2006
    Tested push on 3rd edition (N93). The home directory is expected to be at e:/Python, if that hasn't been created,
    push creates it (and e:/Python/lib where the libraries should go).
    snapshot window can be hidden by hitting "q" in that window.

    More snapping functionality. If you call "snap" from the command line, you'll get a snapshot
    from the current display screen of the phone, and you can optionally save the file on PC. 
    This should work also for other applications, if you
    change them on the foreground on the phone. However, if the phone application uses direct screen 
    access (for example most 3D applications do) then you get only the blank screen that Symbian knows of,
    not what you actually see on the screen.
    Another command "view imgfile.jpg" for imgfile.jpg that resides on the phone displays it on PC.
    Type "man view" and "man snap" for details.
    Minus and plus keys (PC Python keycodes 43 and 45) will enlarge or shrink the snapshot window (between
    1x and 4x). You may see JPG compression artifacts in the images, all snapshots are compressed before
    sending to PC.

    Now if you call from your program sys.stdout.snap() it'll pop out window on push.
    There's also
        def show_imgfile( self, filename ):
            """ send a jpg or png image stored in a file to PC push which displays it """
        def show_img( self, img, title='image' ):
            """ send an image to PC push which displays it """
    wrap inside try except in case you're not running under push

May 20, 2006
    new functions snap and view (man snap, man view) for taking a screen snapshot and viewing
    images from the phone, respectively

    rm command takes now multiple arguments with wild cards
    run does not require .py ending (run hello.py and run hello should work the same way)
    more printouts during sync when loading files from phone to pc

May 16, 2006
    if the application running on the phone did a flush when the outputbuffer was empty, push on the PC side
    got out of sync, crashing. fixed.

May 7, 2006
    changed the run cmd so that it runs with a relatively clean globals dictionary with __name__ = '__main__'

    push is not very responsive while you run a script on the phone. however, now it at least prints the output
    out immediately and doesn't buffer them until the command has finished. the output is also sent to the pc
    console from which you started push.

May 2, 2006
    added mkdir
    downloading large files (e.g., MP3 songs) works now better, phpush.py won't run out of memory

Apr 20, 2006
    ls works correctly, interpreter starts at Python home

Mar 29, 2006
    added lots of shell commands, type man to find out which ones (and then man ls, etc.)
    added syncl, sync with load

Mar 26, 2006
    startup file actually runs now within the push interpreter
    type push_help() to get help on supported commands

Mar 16, 2006
    Birth of push
    changed from using two BT connections and a dummy terminal to a smarter PC gui
    that only uses 1 BT connection both for the interpreter and file synchronization

New putool

Old pytool

    a simpler ascii header for binary data

Mar 8, 2006
    changed the way binary data header (data length, checksum) is sent or received, it must be encoded to ASCII
    syncl reloads the modules in lowercase
    btconsole sets home directory first, always adds HOME/my to sys.path
    syncd creates a directory if needed for files downloaded from the phone
