RELEASE NOTE FOR SERIES 60 2ND EDITION SDK FOR SYMBIAN OS
SUPPORTING FEATURE PACK 2 
SUPPORTING MICROSOFT VISUAL C++ 
JAPANESE EDITION
========================================================================

Product Description:
====================
The Series 60 SDK for Symbian OS enables application development for
devices based on Series 60 platform using C++. The SDK is based on 
Series 60 Developer Platform 2nd Edition - Supporting Feature Pack 2
and Symbian OS 8.0a. The SDK includes  all key functionality needed
for application development (documentation, API reference, add-on 
tools, emulator, target compiler) excluding IDE. 
This SDK supports Microsoft Visual Studio 6 and Microsoft Visual Studio 
.NET 2003 Professional.
Borland 1.5 is not officially supported IDE, althought mentioned in SDK Documentation.

Series 60 Platform is a complete smartphone reference design. It 
represents a rich environment for developers to create exciting content 
and innovative applications. The platform builds on the Symbian 
operating system Symbian OS, complementing it with a configurable 
graphical user interface library and a comprehensive suite of reference
applications. A set of robust components and many varied APIs are 
provided for developers. The APIs supplied are used extensively by the 
suite of "standard" applications, but they have been designed to be 
re-used by independent software vendors as well.

System Requirements:
====================
Basic Requirements:
- Microsoft Windows XP SP1a or Microsoft Windows 2000 SP3
  tested with Windows XP SP1a
- IDE: Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0 or Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003 Professional
- Minimum 1 GHz Pentium PC, 256 MB of memory
- 450 MB free disk space, other requirements as required by the IDE
  used

Additional Requirements:
- Installation/uninstallation of the SDK requires local admin rights.
- Active Perl 5.6.1 build 531 for SDK build tools. Newer or older
  versions of Perl may not be fully compatible with Symbian toolchain.
  Perl must be installed before using the SDK to build applications.
- Use of the emulator menubar, Application Wizard and Symbian UI tools:
  Sisar, AIFBuilder and  CS Help Compiler require a Java runtime
  to be installed.
  Java Runtime version 1.4.1_02 or later is required.
- EnvironmentSwitch tool requires Microsoft XML Core Services (MSXML)
  to work. Preferred version is 4.0 or later.
- When developing Bluetooth applications, a fast (recommended >2GHz, 512
  MB of memory) desktop machine is required. The supported Bluetooth card 
  protocols are BCSP and H4.

Compatibility Issues:
=====================

Emulator differences to Series 60 devices
-----------------------------------------
- Telephony functionality not supported in emulator. An actual device
  is required to test applications that use Telephony APIs.
- Security features such as DRM are not featured in the emulator.
- Videocamera feature is not supported.

Changes in Series 60 - Binary Breaks
------------------------------------ 
- Series 60 2nd Edition SDK - Supporting Feature Pack 2 is 
  based on Symbian OS version 8.0a. Major Changes are
  documented in Symbian Developer Library at:
  Developer Library » Symbian OS Guide » 
  Migration guides » Migrating from Symbian OS v7.0s to v8.0a

- Source Compatibility breaks since Series 60 SDK 2.1 
    + Bluetooth implementation has changed considerably.
      Release documentation does not reflect all changes.
      See document README_BLUETOOTH.txt included in
      downloadable package of SDK.
    + WAP stack has been removed from Series 60. HTTP 
      framework should be used instead.


Unsupported or deprecated SDK functionality
-------------------------------------------
- Release emulator and WINS UREL build target are no longer
  supported and will be removed from SDK in future.
- Sisar, AIF Builder and CS Help Compiler UI tools may or may not
  work properly with this release of the Series 60 SDK. These
  applications will be removed from SDK in future. It is
  recommended to use corresponding command line tools:
     + makesis
     + epocaif.pl (and aiftool.bat)
     + cshlpcmp

Co-existence with earlier SDKs
------------------------------
- The Devices command is the recommended way to change between
  SDK build toolchains. SDKs based on Symbian releases 6.1
  or earlier require use of "Environmentswitch" tool. See
  documentation for Environmentswitch for more information.

Known Issues:
===========

Installation/Uninstallation
---------------------------
- SDK Installer does not check presence of installed Perl or Java. It is recommended that Perl and Java are installed before installing the SDK.
- SDK installation path should not contain spaces. Currently, 
  installer allows selecting a path which contains spaces, but the functionality
  of a SDK installed to such path will fail.
- repair installation works partially.
  Workaround:
  1. Uninstall the SDK
  2. Reinstall the SDK

Build Tools
-----------
- Epoc, bldmake, eshell and makmake do not work when executed on other
  drive than where the SDK is installed.

Emulator
--------
- Following content types are supported in the emulator: .wmf, .bmp, .gif, .jpg,
  .jpeg, .ota, .tiff, .mbm, .tif, .png. E.g. following content types 
  are not supported in emulator: .3gp, .rm.
- Window server short cut keys Ctrl + Alt + Shift + E / D / W / H / T do not
  work in emulator.
- Task switching from emulator menu button does not work (in udeb emulator)
- Function keys "Alt + F2" and "F8 " do not work in the emulator.
- Recorder application cannot be started.
- Application Manager shows a harmless error message at exit.
- Chat and Presence application misbehaves after invalid login (What is the correct login then?)
- Operator Menu application is not functional in this release of SDK.
- "Send As" functionality of built-in emulator applications is not supported. 
  Hence, for example sending Business Cards from Contacts application will
  fail. 
- Downloading content over Ethernet Connection is not supported for built-in
  applications. For instance Application Manager cannot be used to download
  application packages over Internet.
- Infrared and Bluetooth connections in the emulator are supported for 
  developer applications when necessary hardware peripherals 
  are properly configured. Built-in emulator applications
  do not support Bluetooth or Infrared connections.
- General Settings application should not be used to configure connections. 
  Use Edit->Preferences instead. General Settings application does not 
  support telephony related functions.
- In emulator mail settings, it is recommended to use plain ip-addresses
  instead of domain names.
- There are some different translations in help and in the menu of applications.
- SDK Help contains no information about infrared.
- SDK Help will display with certain keywords extra empty results with topic "untitled".  if Japanese Windows is used this title will be displayed in Japanese.


Connectivity
------------
- In some environments Ethernet Support fails to initialize correctly.
  Workaround: Start npacket service manually. The detailed steps are as follows:
  -- Assumption: ethernet support is configured using configuration UI
  -- in Emulator -> Tools -> Preferences -> Ethernet Settings
  1. Start emulator
  2. Start Browser (or another application using TCP/IP)
  3. Start application called npacketadmin.exe from 
     \<SDK_Installation>\Epoc32\tools
  4. From npacketadmin UI select the network adapter you are 
     using for TCP/IP connectivity. 
  5. Check the status. Correct state should be "STARTED", when emulator
     is running.
  6. If status is "STOPPED", close the emulator.
  7. After emulator has been shut down. Select "Start" button.
  8. When status has changed to "STARTED", restart emulator.
  9. Test that browser functions normally.
- E-Mail application does not support DNS resolving. Hence, e-mail
  server address must be given as a numeric IP address. Using
  symbolic names is not possible.

Documentation
-------------
- New APIs are partially documented in this release
- Header eikedwin.h (class CEikEdwin) is not documented
- Example application are partially documented in this release

Series 60 Examples
------------------
- BTHCI Example is removed from this release of SDK. Documentation
  for that example is still part of the SDK documentation.
- Due to changes in Bluetooth implementation Bluetooth examples in
  current SDK are not backwards compatible. These examples cannot be 
  run in devices based on earlier releases of Series 60.
